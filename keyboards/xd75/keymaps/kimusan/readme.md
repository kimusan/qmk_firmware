## XD75 Programmers Layout ##
### by Kim Schulz <kim@mechkeys.tech> ###


This layout is made with the philosophy that brackets and braces should be easily accessable on the
primary layer.

Besides this the layout comes with 3 extra layers:
Fn0 > first function layer with delete on the backspace key and arrowkeys in the lower right corner
Fn1 > Secondary function layer with F1-F12 on the upper row, numpad in the middle and arrow keys in the lower right corner
Special > Media controls, soft reset to bootloader, RGB controls.

Other than this simple Colemak and Dvorak layouts are also available as sticky layouts 



Roadmap:
- add media + RGB control to the special layer
- Add more functionality to Fn0 layer (or maybe swap it with Fn1)
- make Colemak/dvorak layouts  programming specific as well

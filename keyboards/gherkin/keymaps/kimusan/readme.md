# A 3-layer Gherkin layout

This layout is meant to give most of the normal keys needed in order to use the 30-key gherkin for daily usage.

The layers are accessed by holding down the Q (layer 1) and A (layer 2). 
Ctrl is available by holding down Z (yeah no ctrl-z for you) and Shift is available by holding down ESC.

Arrows are on Second layer along with the Function keys (F1-F12).

Numbers are on layer 1 on upper row (0 is on second row).

Some of the punctuation is places on layer 1 available for the right hand.
